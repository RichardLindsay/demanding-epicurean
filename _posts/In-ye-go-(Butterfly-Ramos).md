I love the Ramos Gin Fizz. I love the fact that it takes half an hour to make and that without electricity you'd burn 12,546 calories in the process.

I love bars that embrace it and add it to their menu despite knowing that it's a nightmare when the bar is 4 deep.

When visiting Barcelona this past November we, of course, had a list of bars we had to frequent. Two Schmucks was at the very top.

I still dream about the Coconut Ramos I had, so I thought I'd recreate it, with a few tweaks of course.

I really wanted to make a blue drink (late to the party, I know) so I made a Butterfly Pea flower simple syrup. Butterfly Pea flowers macerate to a beautiful indigo colour without changing the flavour massively. If anything they add a slight earthiness.

Simply bring equal parts by weight of sugar and water to the boil. Remove from the heat and add 10 flowers. Let the mixture sit until cooled, then strain.

I also wanted to introduce the coconut flavour that had been so good at Two Schmucks. I swapped out double/heavy cream for coconut cream and used my co2 rig to carbonate coconut water which would replace the sparkling original.

Carbonating a liquid adds a slight acidity so when building the cocktail I eased off on the lemon and lime juice.

The recipe is as follows:

* 60ml Empress 1908 gin
* 10ml lemon juice
* 10ml lime juice
* 30ml Butterfly Pea simple syrup (see above)
* 30ml coconut cream
* 1 egg white
* 60ml carbonated coconut water

Combine all the ingredients except the coconut water in a mixing tin.

Dry shake until very frothy (approx 4 days). Add ice and shake until icy cold. Double strain into a rocks glass over ice and place in the fridge for 1 minute.

Remove from the fridge and, using a straw, make a hole in the centre of the foam. Pour the coconut water through the hole and watch as the head protrudes above the top of the glass.

I appreciate that I need to up my camera game. Please bear with me.

It's a coconut Ramos, what's not to like.
