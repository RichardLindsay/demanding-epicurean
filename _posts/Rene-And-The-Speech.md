Having not long returned home from Honeymoon and being understandably skint, we thought it was all over. We were wrong...

Food is an addiction. Just when you think you've visited every restaurant you've ever dreamt of, another appears on the horizon.

My brother's 30th birthday was fast approaching and his present was a no brainer. Michael, as I've eluded to previously, is passionate about food. He is an incredible cook and one day he will listen to us and work at the very top.

I've never been as terrified booking a restaurant. Noma 2.0 was supposed to open at the end of January 2018, just in time for Michael's Birthday. An ancient wall found in the grounds of it's new location delayed the launch and I began to panic.

Finally, booking day arrived. I had what felt like 12 alarms set for 4pm, the time the reservations would go live. At around 3pm I started to refresh, continuously. I don't know why. I'm not sure if it was nerves or blind hope but I had a feeling that the tables would open early. At around 3:30pm and from the corner of my eye I noticed that the page had changed, this is it.

Because this iteration of Noma was brand new, they weren't 100% sure of the restaurant layout. This meant that you could only book in even numbers and, of course, 5 of us were going to be dining. I could either pay for an extra meal that would never be enjoyed or cut my mum. After a long hard think, I opted for the missed meal.

It was booked and I was like a kid at Christmas. I contacted my family to let them know. We had agreed to keep the present a surprise from Michael until Christmas.

He was ecstatic. He'd never been to a restaurant with the stature of Noma before and we knew he'd love it.
