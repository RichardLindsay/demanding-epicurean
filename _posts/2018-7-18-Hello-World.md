After literally weeks and weeks of being told to write this blog by family and friends, I've decided to listen...

I've been pretty fortunate. I've been to a lot of the World's best restaurants and I'll be honest it keeps me awake at night.

Thinking back to when I gazed over the French Riviera at Mirazur or chatted the breeze with Massimo at Osteria Francescana, I can't help but smile.

My life was turned upside down a few years back when my best friend died of Leukaemia. If I'm totally honest, I'm still not sure if I've come to terms with it. It was an horrific time.

It changed my life. The only shimmer of light; it made me realise what was important in life. Not money, not material things but experiences and moments.

Claire, my wife, was a foodie before I met her. She introduced me to eating well and we've driven each other to trying new and trying all. Pre Claire I eat to live.

Food daftness runs in the family. My mother, brother, Claire and I held a fine dining competition this year. I've never been so stressed in all of my life and I'll get to relive it all over again in the coming months when I try to put it into words. The winner of the competition, yet to be revealed, will be treated to a meal at Restaurant Andrew Fairlie in August. It's all very tense.

I aim to blog about my love for food and drink and our experiences at some of the incredible restaurants we have been fortunate to visit. Claire introduced me to food but my love of beer, spirits and cocktails is all of my own making. I love to homebrew beer and mess around with clarification and spherification.

I love cocktails and one day I hope to own a bar. I scout (see what I did there) locations in Glasgow, waiting for that perfect opportunity. Glasgow is an incredible city and the cocktail scene is ready to blow up.

Some of the restaurants and bars I intend to blog about are:

* NOMA
* Osteria Francescana
* Dandelyan
* El Celler De Can Roca
* Mirazur
* The Dead Rabbit
* Eleven Madison Park
* P.D.T.
* Mugaritz
* Candelaria
* Tickets
* Little Red Door
* Restaurant Andrew Fairlie
* Bramble

and many, many more.

I hope you'll join me as I pour my heart out over the following months.

If you have any suggestions, comments or criticisms, please get in touch via Twitter or Instagram.

Cheers

Richard
