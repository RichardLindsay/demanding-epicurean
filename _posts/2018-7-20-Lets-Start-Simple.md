What better way to begin this nonsense than with a drink...

If you weren't aware, June 18th was National Daiquiri Day. I forgot.

A correctly made Daiquiri is one of the finest things on the earth and I wanted to share how I achieve, what I consider to be, a pretty decent version.

I've started messing around with dropping simple syrup in favour of bar spoons of caster/superfine sugar.

I find that 1 bar spoon of sugar equates to roughly a quarter oz/7.5ml of 2:1 finished syrup.

Anyway, my recipe is as follows:

* 2oz/60ml of white rum
* 1oz/30ml freshly squeezed lime juice
* 2 bar spoons of caster/superfine sugar

Combine all the ingredients in a cocktail shaker and stir until the sugar has dissolved.

Add ice and shake until the tin turns icy cold.

Double strain into a frozen coupe glass and garnish with a lime wheel.

Simple but absolutely incredible!
